- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kesduden
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science with a side specialization in Node.js since I love Javascript, I also want to learn Kaboom.js for fun since I love games and game desigining interests me. I love algorithm solving and want to get really good on it one day.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any form of remote internship on JS or Data Science,as long as I dont have to pay.
